Relational Data Model Database

This repository contains an implementation of a simple relational database system based on the relational data model. The project comprises three parts, each with specific requirements.

Project Overview

Part 1
Implemented a database with relations similar to the "Registrar" database in FOCS Figs. 8.1 and 8.2.
Created basic functions for single-relation insert, delete, and lookup operations.
Populated the tables with data from Appendix A.
Demonstrated operations with specific queries.

Part 2
Developed a function to answer queries about a player's jersey number when playing for a team.
Implemented a function to answer queries about the number of goals a player scored on a specific date.Demonstrated these functions using a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).

Part 3
Implemented relational algebra operations as described in FOCS Section 8.8 and evaluated specific expressions.


How to run the code:
1. compile the "Relations.c" file using "gcc Relations.c" or "gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror Relations.c"
2. run the executable by typing "./a.out" in the command line
